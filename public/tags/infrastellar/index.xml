      <description>6 Catastrophe is always just around the corner.
Complex systems possess potential for catastrophic failure. Human practitioners are nearly always in close physical and temporal proximity to these potential failures – disaster can occur at any time and in nearly any place. The potential for catastrophic outcome is a hallmark of complex systems. It is impossible to eliminate the potential for such catastrophic failure; the potential for such failure is always present by the system’s own nature.</description>

      <description>Recently I posted on LinkedIn that I am starting a new adventure as a business owner and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more excited about this opportunity. The company is called Infrastellar Systems and we will be focused on building tools and processes for running small to large infrastructure systems in a reliable fashion.
Running a company has been a dream of mine for some time and I want to build a sustainable, value-driven company; one that treasures the valuable resources of this world and doesn&amp;rsquo;t squander them for meaningless riches for a select few.</description>

      <description>Recently I posted on LinkedIn that I am starting a new adventure as a business owner and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more excited about this opportunity. The company is called Infrastellar Systems and we will be focused on building tools and processes for running small to large infrastructure systems in a reliable fashion.
Running a company has been a dream of mine for some time and I want to build a sustainable, value-driven company; one that treasures the valuable resources of this world and doesn&amp;rsquo;t squander them for meaningless riches for a select few.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;Recently I &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:6960249439840043009?utm_source=linkedin_share&amp;amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_share&amp;amp;utm_content=post&#34;&gt;posted on LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt; that I am starting a new
adventure as a business owner and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be more excited about this
opportunity. The company is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://infrastellar.systems&#34;&gt;Infrastellar Systems&lt;/a&gt; and we
will be focused on building tools and processes for running small to large
infrastructure systems in a reliable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Running a company has been a dream of mine for some time and I want to build a
sustainable, value-driven company; one that treasures the valuable resources of
this world and doesn&amp;rsquo;t squander them for meaningless riches for a select few.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Infrastellar Systems aims to be a one-hundred year infrastructure company. What
that means exactly we&amp;rsquo;re still figuring out, but the company needs to be
sustainable and responsive to changes in tech, society, and economies. It needs
to be one that doesn&amp;rsquo;t lock people in to ensure we acquire the next buck but
build value into the people who use our tools so that they can make the
decisions that benefit their business. Honestly it seems absurdly difficult to
build a business given the state of the world at the moment, but I&amp;rsquo;m excited to
try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I intend to share more details on how I am approaching this adventure here on
this site and &lt;a href=&#34;https://infrastellar.systems&#34;&gt;Infrastellar Systems&lt;/a&gt;. I invite you to join me for
this adventure. I am also very interested in &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:asenchi@asenchi.com&#34;&gt;hearing from
you&lt;/a&gt; about what you think is required for a business
to succeed in today&amp;rsquo;s environment.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>About me I&amp;rsquo;m an infrastructure engineer. I live near Lansing, MI. I am particularly interested in Resilience Engineering when applied to complex infrastructure systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed to work on some relatively large platforms including EngineYard, Heroku, GitHub, Simple (RIP), and VMware Tanzu.
I am also interested in the intersection of complex systems and humans in the area of incident management. I have developed a system called the Incident Complexity Framework and am working on a book and training course for helping companies apply incident management practices.</description>
      <content>&lt;h1 id=&#34;about-me&#34;&gt;About me&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m an infrastructure engineer. I live near Lansing, MI. I am particularly
interested in &lt;a href=&#34;https://erikhollnagel.com/ideas/resilience-engineering.html&#34;&gt;Resilience Engineering&lt;/a&gt; when applied to
complex infrastructure systems. I&amp;rsquo;ve been blessed to work on some relatively
large platforms including &lt;a href=&#34;https://engineyard.com&#34;&gt;EngineYard&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://heroku.com&#34;&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://simple.com&#34;&gt;Simple&lt;/a&gt;
(RIP), and &lt;a href=&#34;https://tanzu.vmware.com/&#34;&gt;VMware Tanzu&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also interested in the intersection of complex systems and humans in the
area of incident management. I have developed a system called the Incident
Complexity Framework and am working on a book and training course for helping
companies apply incident management practices. I gave a talk about an early
version of this system at &lt;a href=&#34;https://monitorama.com&#34;&gt;Monitorama&lt;/a&gt; in 2015. You can view that
&lt;a href=&#34;https://vimeo.com/131385891&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of computers I imagine a world where technology is used to benefit
people and not consume the world in greed. Unfortunately we are a long way from
this happening. Ultimately, I think software should compliment human driven
progress and not overwhelm it.&lt;/p&gt;

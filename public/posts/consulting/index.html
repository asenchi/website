        <p>This week I posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/curt-micol-852472178_in-addition-to-the-work-i-am-doing-at-infrastellar-activity-6982748228479844353-Pteh?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/asenchi/status/1576983616315445249">Twitter</a> that I was
making myself available to consult with companies on their infrastructure. I
thought I might dive into why I am doing this.</p>
<h2 id="starting-a-business">Starting a Business<a href="#starting-a-business" class="hanchor" ariaLabel="Anchor">&#8983;</a> </h2>
<p>Starting a business is hard, especially when considering building
software. Open source is predominant (rightfully so) and Software as a Service
(SaaS) is the trend. I have spent the past couple of months working through a
business plan and have some pretty ambitious goals.</p>
<p>Having a plan is all well and good, and I started diving in right away. However
I realized two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>My life outside of work has been incredibly busy and required more attention
than I was willing to acknowledge.</li>
<li>My experience in the tech industry has been comprised of bleeding edge tech
startups that represent a small portion of the practices around
infrastructure and incident management.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first point is just a matter of timelines lining up. With a family and
responsibilities there isn&rsquo;t much I can do here. It is a reality that I have to
live with that my time right now comes at a higher cost. Everything is fine and
our family is flourishing, and part of that is because I prioritize that work.</p>
<p>I have also found that when working alone it easy to make that excuse. The
flexibility itself needs to be constrained and while I am working on that it
means I have to find a practical way forward to be able to sustain my work.</p>
<p>The second point was something I have thought about for a while. I have a few
products that I am working on that would benefit from a more varied perspective
than the startups I have worked for. It is true I worked at
<a href="https://tanzu.vmware.com">VMware</a>, which is
anything but a startup, however, the business unit I was in was very
similar. We were quite isolated from the rest of the company and had autonomy
to make the decisions we needed to succeed.</p>
<p>There are a lot of companies out there that have production systems that are a
vastly different shape than some of those I have worked on. I want to build
products that help them. I also want to understand where the pain is that they
are experiencing. It would be easy for me to build something I <em>think</em> is
right, but it means much more to users to build something that <em>works</em> for
them.</p>
<p>Given the cross section of these two areas I think it is good time to open up
my time to others. Not only does this provide me some income while I do this
research but it also gives me a more clearly defined schedule while I work on
getting organized.</p>
<p>Honestly, I&rsquo;m pretty excited about the prospect. I have learned over the years
that I only see in part and working with others produces something much more
fulfilling. I want to help companies develop empathetic incident management
systems, build and managed infrastructure that doesn&rsquo;t immediately become a
heaping pile of technical debt, and help companies grow their infrastructure
while being easy to maintain and adapt to their business needs.</p>
<p>I have a proven track record of reliable, pragmatic solutions when it comes to
infrastructure, incident management, and team building. I think I can help your
company improve in some of these areas. If you have a problem that you need
help on, reach out to me at
<a href="mailto:asenchi@infrastellar.systems">asenchi@infrastellar.systems</a> and let&rsquo;s
chat.</p>
<p>I look forward to working with you.</p>

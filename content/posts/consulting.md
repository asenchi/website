This week I posted on [LinkedIn][linkedin] and [Twitter][twitter] that I was
making myself available to consult with companies on their infrastructure. I
thought I might dive into why I am doing this.

## Starting a Business

Starting a business is hard, especially when considering building
software. Open source is predominant (rightfully so) and Software as a Service
(SaaS) is the trend. I have spent the past couple of months working through a
business plan and have some pretty ambitious goals.

Having a plan is all well and good, and I started diving in right away. However
I realized two things:

* My life outside of work has been incredibly busy and required more attention
  than I was willing to acknowledge.
* My experience in the tech industry has been comprised of bleeding edge tech
  startups that represent a small portion of the practices around
  infrastructure and incident management.

The first point is just a matter of timelines lining up. With a family and
responsibilities there isn't much I can do here. It is a reality that I have to
live with that my time right now comes at a higher cost. Everything is fine and
our family is flourishing, and part of that is because I prioritize that work.

I have also found that when working alone it easy to make that excuse. The
flexibility itself needs to be constrained and while I am working on that it
means I have to find a practical way forward to be able to sustain my work.

The second point was something I have thought about for a while. I have a few
products that I am working on that would benefit from a more varied perspective
than the startups I have worked for. It is true I worked at
[VMware](https://tanzu.vmware.com), which is
anything but a startup, however, the business unit I was in was very
similar. We were quite isolated from the rest of the company and had autonomy
to make the decisions we needed to succeed.

There are a lot of companies out there that have production systems that are a
vastly different shape than some of those I have worked on. I want to build
products that help them. I also want to understand where the pain is that they
are experiencing. It would be easy for me to build something I _think_ is
right, but it means much more to users to build something that _works_ for
them.

Given the cross section of these two areas I think it is good time to open up
my time to others. Not only does this provide me some income while I do this
research but it also gives me a more clearly defined schedule while I work on
getting organized.

Honestly, I'm pretty excited about the prospect. I have learned over the years
that I only see in part and working with others produces something much more
fulfilling. I want to help companies develop empathetic incident management
systems, build and managed infrastructure that doesn't immediately become a
heaping pile of technical debt, and help companies grow their infrastructure
while being easy to maintain and adapt to their business needs.

I have a proven track record of reliable, pragmatic solutions when it comes to
infrastructure, incident management, and team building. I think I can help your
company improve in some of these areas. If you have a problem that you need
help on, reach out to me at
[asenchi@infrastellar.systems](mailto:asenchi@infrastellar.systems) and let's
chat.

I look forward to working with you.

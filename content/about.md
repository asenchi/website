# About me

I'm an infrastructure engineer. I live near Lansing, MI. I am particularly
interested in [Resilience Engineering][] when applied to
complex infrastructure systems. I've been blessed to work on some relatively
large platforms including [EngineYard][], [Heroku][], [GitHub][], [Simple][]
(RIP), and [VMware Tanzu][].

I am also interested in the intersection of complex systems and humans in the
area of incident management. I have developed a system called the Incident
Complexity Framework and am working on a book and training course for helping
companies apply incident management practices. I gave a talk about an early
version of this system at [Monitorama] in 2015. You can view that
[here](https://vimeo.com/131385891).

Outside of computers I imagine a world where technology is used to benefit
people and not consume the world in greed. Unfortunately we are a long way from
this happening. Ultimately, I think software should compliment human driven
progress and not overwhelm it.
